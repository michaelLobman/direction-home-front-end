# ~~No~~ Direction Home

~~No~~ Direction Home is a React App for Bob Dylan fans. Welcome home.

## Description

There are **Bob Dylan** websites, and there are Bob Dylan **websites**. This is the latter - an application as invested in Dylan's music as it is functionality and user experience.

## Usage

With four unique pages, ~~No~~ Direction Home gives users a bit of every. On the "Home" page, watch as every five seconds a new curated Dylan lyric appears in the Lyric Window.

Or perhaps you enjoy ranking things (who doesn't?), in which case, you can rank the top 10 Dylan songs on the "Rank Songs" page. Don't forget to save your changes if you're confident in your ratings!

Enjoy some live Dylan videos on the "Live" page and add your own personal Dylan moment to the community-run "Moments" page.

## Support 

This app will be continuously updated as I progress through Flatiron's curriculum and can build out additional functionality. 

If you have any suggestions, questions, or Dylan impressions, email me at michael.lobman@gmail.com.
